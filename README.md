## FullStack Netflix Clone Project

In this project, I tried to make a small clone of Netflix. APIs were written in the backend via TMDB and requests were made from the frontend. Zustand was used as state management, and login operations were done with json web token. It is also a responsive design site.

## FrontEnd
- Axios
- Zustand
- React Player
- Tailwind Css
- Luscide React
- React Hot Toast

## BackEnd
- Axios
- BcrypteJs
- Cookie-Parser
- DotEnv
- JsonWebToken
- Nodemon

## Database
- MongoDb
